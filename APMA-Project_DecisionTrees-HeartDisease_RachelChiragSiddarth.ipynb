    "<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the major issues with heart disease is the difficulty of properly diagnosing patients, especially because many of the tests involved in diagnosing a patient involves expensive tests, which are oftentimes not readily available in many regions of the world. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The objective of this project is to develop a web app interface that patients can use themselves, as a pre-screening mechanism. Already, previous research has explored various data analysis methods for predicting heart disease in a patient, with accuracy results maximized at ~78%. Our intent is expand upon these past efforts in a manner which is usable for the patients, as a pre-screening rating system. </p>"

    "<p>The figure  [4] above demonstrates the reason why Decision Trees are preferred in instances where the relationship between the responses and the features is nonlinear and complex. In addition, Trees can be displayed graphically allowing end users to understand the data and can also handle qualitative variables without having the need to create dummy variables. This is prefered in predictive health science as the datasets are normally complex with a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables. In addition, having an easily interpretable graph would help patients better understand the results without having to consult an expert. However, Trees have a number of shortcomings which include the lack of predictive accuracy and robustness when compared to other regression and classification techniques.</p>\n",

The authors found that the combination of equal frequency discretization and Gain ratio Decision Tree with nine voting showed the best performance accuracy (84.1%) in diagnosing heart disease.</p>"
